The files in this directory are used as the Django settings module when
deploying the web front-end servers, by setting the environment variable
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE (using Python module dot syntax, not path syntax,
e.g., endagaweb.settings.dev). There is a simple linear relationship
between them:

prod.py - base front-end deployment (used in both production and staging
tiers of the cloud environment). Does not include admin capabilities.

staff.py - adds admin capabilities to the web front-end.

dev.py - override some staff settings in order to enable simpler local
deployment, e.g., no nginx front-end, no https.

[In other words: staff = prod + admin. dev = staff + local dev changes.]

Note that Django requires that all variables used as settings be defined
in the exact module specified in DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE, hence the use of
the 'from foo import *' syntax to 'inherit' all definitions into one module.
